  <p>I'm Tushar Gupta - I'm a software Developer, designer, founder and undergraduate student at Chandigarh University. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and skills to improve   my craft. I am outgoing, dedicated, and open-minded. I get across to people and adjust to changes with ease. I believe that a person should work on developing their professional skills and learning new things all the time. Currently, I am looking for new career opportunities.
